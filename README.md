# Would it be useful to only look at retweeted and favourite tweet messages?
# Explain your answer.

Considering we are interested in tweets that have information of substance to convey one can make the argument that dropping tweets that have not been retweeted would be a safe way forward in reducing the sample size without loosing knowledge. The project decided to continue working on the full dataset to provide the breadth of views expressed on the platform when it comes to NHS.

Key findings and recommendations

The NHS networks were well resourced to meet demand for the given period, with utilisation averaging 75%. Focus areas should be to mitigate risks were bottlenecks can occur and by refining the current reporting and data management to benefit from data driven operations especially during the busiest months of October, November.

1	Analysing historical data covering a period where the UK was affected by the pandemic, the project showed that only a fraction of the appointments booked were not attended (<10%). It is reasonable to predict that this number will only get smaller in the time after the investigated time window, considering the social norm will be restored post-pandemic. 

2	The project identified that the biggest set of appointments are served by GP. Considering this is an area of potential congestion and bottle-neck formation, it is part of this projectâs recommendation that the NHS investigates for alternative ways to deliver appointments were possible. Investing in upskilling other practice staff and / or improving triage stages could be considered to mitigate this risk.

3	Face-to-face meetings were shown to be the most popular. The project suggests that NHS invests in other means to deliver consultation and at the same in educating people to take up alternative routes such as tele-health appointments. Resource management will benefit from the agility that virtual settings can offer.

4	Most appointments were made a day before they were supposed to take place. While this will be a hard requirement for certain health conditions, the project suggests that the NHS promotes longer periods to allow for efficient resource allocation to settle in a more optimal way, given that with more time both the demand and supply will be able to make arrangements and indeed be successful at the point of contact.

5	The analysis showed that the NHS resource networks were well prepared for the given period. Utilisation never came close to exceeding capacity, indicating that the NHS should focus in optimising the existing resource allocation as well as reducing the missed appointments rather than injecting head count.

6	Investing in robust reporting and data management is also an area that the NHS can benefit from improving. This was identified by revealing trends in the service setting spread, indicating that the unmapped appointments were the second largest service setting, especially during the busiest months. This means that when busy the NHS reporting suffers, when this is when data driven management will help the most in resource allocation and operational management.
